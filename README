Super Secure File

Get a super secure file encrypted locally using a specified password and access it anywhere by just knowing the password. It makes use of Google Drive to store the encrypted data and does all the cryptography locally (the key never leaves your computer).

Any analysis is welcome. I'll be more than happy to learn the potential vulnerabilities in implementation.
